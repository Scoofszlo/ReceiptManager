# ReceiptManager

## Introduction
ReceiptManager (initially known as ReceiptChecker) is a command-line program that lets you manage and create receipt entries. You can calculate the total price of each entry based on its unit price and quantity. It can also calculate the sum of all receipt entries, as well as the total number of items.

## Features
- <b>Edit Receipt Entry</b>: You can add, edit, and delete entries you want.
- <b>Live Preview</b>: You can see the live changes to your entries in real-time.
- <b>Export files as .TXT or .JSON</b>: You can export the results with formatted design using .TXT file or, if you want to import it later, you cane export it as a .JSON file.
- <b>Sort by Price</b>: You can sort the items based on the total price of entries in descending order to see which items have the highest or lowest price.
- <b>One-click Run</b>: THere is no need to install programs, extensions, or any other dependencies to run this program.

## How to Use?
- To run the program, simply click the `ReceiptManager.exe`. There is no need for you to install other extensions, programs, or dependencies.
- Type a number to use the functions of the program

## Limitations
- <b>Works on Windows only</b>: The program was only created and tested in Windows operating system. I have no plans yet for supporting other operating systems.

## Disclaimer
- This is a hobby project, so this program may not be fully optimized. The development for this project is not very serious (for now), as I only work on it when I have free time. This project was initially based on a school project for my IT subject, so there are some areas of the code that are part of the original version.
- As I want to improve my knowledge in programming, I decided to use this project as my stepping stone.
