# ReceiptChecker

## Introduction
ReceiptChecker is a Python program that reads a list of receipt entries from a text file and calculates the total price of each entry based on its unit price and quantity. It also calculates the sum of all receipt entries, as well as the total number of items. This project was programmed in Visual Studio Code using Python as its programming language.

## Features
- <b>Sort by Price</b>: You can sort the items based on the total price of entries in descending order to see which items have the highest or lowest price.
- <b>Entry Checker</b>: Checks whether entries have invalid values (e.g., incorrect item names, incorrect price values, etc.).


## Disclaimer
- This project was created as a requirement for our programming subject DASTRUC (Data Structures and Algorithms). For this reason, the project has very limited features and functions. Therefore, this program might not be very useful for everyone. However, I plan to improve this program over time so that it can be more useful.

## Limitations
- <b>ACcepted Price Format</b>: The program only accepts prices with a "P" at the start (e.g., P25.00, P46.50, etc.). Values without "P" or with any other characters at the start will trigger an error.
- <b>Limited Features</b>: Due to limited features, there is not much to explore as it only calculates the prices and the total number of items in receipt entries.
